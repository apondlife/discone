mired in debt
---

# bugs/problems
- grip (or something) pulls you over corners weirdly (on the frame collision misses; should it pull you towards the hit point?)
- can't get into jumpsquat after first aerial jump (if there's not infinite air jumps)
- jumping in a tight corner (wall & ground) sometimes has no effect (happens in birthplace)
- inertia sometimes explodes when character is stuck
- transfer in a vpipe doesn't work nicely
- recover broken overworld terrain (git history)
- movement system uses coyote time
- interaction between eyes closed dialogue and dream dialogue
    - closing eyed before finishing dream tutorial, breaks sequence (see Intro_Skip)
- transition from fixed cameras to character camera has bad rotation in in-between state

# debt
- need to manually enable input actions
- head ik direction only works for some models
- default speed of head ik is poorly tuned
- having zero jumps is not considered
