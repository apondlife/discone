# necessary
- [x] aerial movement, drift
- [x] good tuning for m---o
- [ ] buffering, input handling (jump)
- [ ] landing state
- [ ] coyote time

# housekeeping
- [ ] make it easier to switch tunables
- [ ] big renaming
- [x] namespace
- [ ] code reorg after some more complexity
- [ ] consolidate

# fun & extra
- [ ] aerial turning
- [ ] movement particles
- [ ] slower in air movement feedback/state
- [ ] hitting the ground particles
- [ ] separate tuning for cart
  - [ ] be able to switch between cart and mario modes
- [ ] interactions with walls
  - [ ] bonking into walls
  - [ ] sliding on walls
    - [ ] sliding up walls
  - [ ] wall jump
- [ ] grabbing edges
- [ ] different jump experiments (axis between fast, long jump & slow, high jump)
- [ ] ai
