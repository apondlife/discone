Jump
----

if you input jump before falling from the ledge, you can release the jump to execute the jump within the coyote frames. if you just hold jump all the way through, the character just float.

you leave the stage, you are in the air, falling. If you input jump, you will start a jumpsquat, if you release jump before the coyote frames end, you jump, otherwise jump squat is just cancelled. (we accept this brief moment where the character does an empty jumpsquat, and its a trick names __squatters delight__)
