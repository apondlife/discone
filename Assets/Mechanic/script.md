# intro

hi

hello?

ah, thanks for pressing my “button”!
sorry to bother you there, earlier.

going forward, i’ll be more respectful of your boundaries.

do you know what you’re doing Here?

don’t worry if you don’t, that’s normal.
we never really do.

but anyways, i’m sure you’ll start to figure out what you’re doing Here soon.

don’t ask me though, i couldn’t tell you.

i can’t tell you, even.

& speaking of asking me, i should introduce myself. you could call me “the mechanic”, if you ever get the chance =).

but if you do want to hear me, i’m usually around here.

if you don’t, well, don’t wait up i guess ;).

# jumping

but yeah, they call me “the mechanic”.
don’t ask me why, haha.

i’ve spent a lifetime “jumping”. 

these days i believe that jumping is more about pushing through than is is about pushing against.

jumping around rather than jumping through.

jumping about rather than jumping  because.

jumping with, too. with your body. with another. with whatever. with all of it 

anyways…
you get it right?

don’t answer that…ha haha ha.

does that make any sense? ugh…

but yeah that “body” part. for me anyways, i really start to feel it after a while.

depending on how i’m feeling it, i’ve i like to close my eyes for a moment.
both of them.

& take a deep breath.
& then i can feel it again.
& differently.

i think that’s why i keep at it.

# flowers

where i come from, flowers are not really for smelling.
or for looking.

it’s one of the things that i like about this place.

they’re all over, everywhere. they smell and look nice.

nice enough to steal my focus occasionally hehe.

you noticed that, too?

the little petals, tiny veins of color snaking through them

bending in the wind, the breeze carrying the scent, but never snapping

reminds me of someone…
myself, haha ha.
and i guess you, too ;)

they’re a bit of a distraction actually, ha ha.

reminds me that there are other preoccupations.

or maybe that something exists outside preoccupation.

> pre occupation

and i like to think about how they came to be.
the hows whys whats whens.

about the somebody, or the nobody, that did the planting.

> no body

they are.
yeah, i only realized this recently.

there, all the flowers were purposed, intentioned.

but here, i’ve found that i don’t need that thought.
and i don’t worry as much.

# feats

back when i was in business full-time…
i’m more of an itinerant business person these days

i’d get an occasional pang of fear.
and i mean occasional, don’t worry about me okay, hah hah.

like, can i do this. is this even possible?

sometimes it wasn’t & i couldn’t.
but usually it was & i could.
i said don’t worry about me alright hahahaaa.

# outro

ah, sorry. i guess i’ve been rambling.

i think i’ll for a walk through the woods, let you get to it.

it’s been really nice, though.

hope we get to meet sometime.
