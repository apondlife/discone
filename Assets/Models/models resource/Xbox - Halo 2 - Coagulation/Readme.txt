Coagulation ripped by Shadowth117 with the Entity model exporter and ADI model extraction library for Halo 2 and Gravemind 1.5 for Halo 2 Vista. I'm not going to force you to give credit, but it would be awesome if you credited Bungie for making this kickass map. 

Note: Some material components will have to be applied manually since neither Collada nor .mtl format supports them. This includes, but is not limited to detail maps, specular maps, and reflection maps among many other things.

Some of the textures were ripped from Halo 2 Vista with Gravemind 1.5 rather than Halo2 because Entity didn't export them correctly or to get the high-res version of a particular texture. Things with high-res textures unfortunately only seem to be UI elements while everything else is pretty much unchanged.
