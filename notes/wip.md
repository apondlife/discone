what is projected
---
- wall particle proportional to wall influence
- wall particle indicates state (attack, hold button)

- directional influence on wall tangent
- ground velocity vs. surface velocity (friction on walls? and jumpng?)

- maybe? wall system no wall gravity (all friction??)
- maybe? cache wall transfer on transfer to prevent adding magnet and input every frame
- maybe? move off wall on jump?
- maybe? vertical attack on wall-to-wall transfer

- look into crouching sliding down ramps
~ ui save paths are not accurate
