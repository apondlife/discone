what is projected

aaa: vertical attack on wall-to-wall transfer

- wall particle proportional to wall influence
- wall particle indicates state (attack, hold button)

- ground velocity vs. surface velocity (friction on walls? and jumpng?)
- ceiling

- maybe? fix wall transfer tangent (goes negative, does weird stuff)
- maybe? wall system no wall gravity (all friction??)

- look into crouching sliding down ramps
~ ui save paths are not accurate
- debug bars ui
